	\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward vertical space
	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Directed initiation, planning and execution project phases of an industrial-grade IoT hardware product and cloud service for both internal and external use. Spearheaded system engineering design as well as programming development. Launched a new, internal, company database.
		\paragraph{Specifics:}\vspace*{-12pt}
		The product enables remote PLC data readout (Allen-Bradley \& Siemens), local-hardware backup \& sync and server data collection (MariaDB). The system supports integration with realtime cloud-based dashboard visualization and data processing (Grafana).
		\item Created and maintained a MATLAB App Designer application software tool (3k+ lines) for company mill-sizing purposes. The tool features multiple internal data-structures, dynamic UI elements and elaborate plot visualizations with built-in data model extrapolations. Approved for use by both sales and engineering departments.
		\item Assessed and systematized methodology for grinding-media filling-level computation. Proposed additional uncertainty correction methods to account for slurry density variation using 3D linear data extrapolation. Collaborated on industrial product design solution.

	\descript{Engineer intern}
	\location{Aug 2019 - Jul 2020 | Baden, CH}
	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Investigated temporal relationship between strain-gauge voltage and grinding-media filling-level. Performed data cleaning and analysis in python via pandas and XGBoost machine learning.
		\item Designed and developed a VBA UserForm script (1k+ lines) for efficient document parsing and automation. Simplified commissioning engineers' workflow and improved team's performance by reducing test-report document processing time by $\approx$83\% per project. 
		\item Consulted in electrical-engineering document standardization. Designed and created standardized templates for piping and instrumentation diagrams.
